# 🦊🧑‍💻️ Furalilty Unity SDK
The Furality Unity SDK is an easy way for attendees to manage their Furality assets (badges, shaders, Patreon goodies, etc),
as well as easily install & manage tools to help them customise!

## ⬇️ Downloads Tab
Provides an easy method to download and import .unitypackages, as well as handles dependencies. For example, if you installed a Furality-created shader that relied on Audiolink,
the Furality SDK would automatically install Audiolink using whatever method is available, be it the VCC or the built-in Unity Package Manager.

## 🛠️ Tools
The tools tab is a quick way to access your installed tools. It provides a unified frontend for them.
